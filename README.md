# python-rdf-reasoner

Given a KG generates step by step inferences and report the inferences of each chain in a different file. It is possible to explore a given inference and to retrieve the chain of axioms that generated that inference.

```python
python2.7 python_rdfs_reasoner.py -f knowledge_graphs/DAO_2.json
```
